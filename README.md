# Wildfire Spread Simulation 🔥

An interactive machine learning-powered wildfire spread simulation that predicts fire propagation patterns based on environmental factors using Python.

## 📋 Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to create a realistic, interactive wildfire simulation system that:

1. **Predicts Wildfire Spread** - Uses machine learning models to simulate how wildfires spread across terrain based on environmental conditions
2. **Interactive Visualization** - Provides real-time graphical simulations with adjustable parameters
3. **Educational Tool** - Helps understand wildfire behavior and the impact of various factors (wind, terrain, vegetation)
4. **Research Platform** - Serves as a foundation for studying fire dynamics and testing mitigation strategies

### Key Features
- Real-time fire spread prediction using trained ML models
- Interactive parameter controls (wind speed/direction, temperature, humidity, vegetation)
- Visual representation of fire intensity and spread patterns
- Support for multiple ignition points
- Playback controls (play, pause, reset, speed adjustment)

## 📊 ML Model Architecture

The project uses a hybrid **CNN-LSTM** or **U-Net** architecture:

- **Input**: Current fire state + environmental parameters (terrain, weather, vegetation)
- **CNN Layers**: Extract spatial features from terrain and vegetation maps
- **LSTM/RNN Layers**: Capture temporal dynamics of fire spread over time
- **Output**: Probability map showing fire spread likelihood for the next timestep

### Input Features
- Terrain: elevation, slope, aspect
- Weather: wind speed/direction, temperature, humidity
- Vegetation: fuel type, fuel moisture, density
- Fire state: current perimeter, intensity, duration

### Output
- 2D grid with fire spread probabilities
- Fire intensity levels
- Predicted burn area and direction
